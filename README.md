# StashAway, "When there is no more room under the bed"
## Overview

For project #3, I created an app that helps people stash money for things they want to buy on a later date. Similar to getting fundings for something you want to do except you fund it yourself. In the app you can fund user can invite friends and create a group stash fund.

**Live site:** <https://stashaway.herokuapp.com/>

## Technologies Used

  * Languages - HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Javascript, React, Nodejs, Express
  * Design - Google Fonts, SweetAlert, Bootstrap
  * Project Planning & User Stories - [Trello](https://trello.com/b/r6GD7zJ7/stashaway)
  * Atom and Visual Studio Code


## Features

  * SweetAlert, for better representation of javascript alerts
  * Create different Stashes and a history of any that have been funded sucess or failed.
  * Login with Google Api to create an account.
  * Stripe to handle payment stashes

## What I learned
Google: It is super easy to create a user with google api
Stripe: Not easy to setup payment plans. Recommend a team for the many security hurdles.
